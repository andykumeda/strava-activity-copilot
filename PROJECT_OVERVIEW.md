# Project Overview & Status

**Last Updated**: January 26, 2026
**Current State**: ✅ Feature Complete & Production Ready

## 📋 Executive Summary
ActivityCopilot is a robust, secure, and performant application allowing users to query their Strava data using LLMs. It features a React frontend, highly optimized FastAPI backend, and an asynchronous MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Strava integration. The system is in **Production** state with enterprise-grade security and modern infrastructure.

## 🚀 Architecture

### System Components
| Component | Port | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | 443 (nginx) | React + Vite app served via nginx |
| **Backend** | 8000 | FastAPI server handling auth, queries, LLM calls |
| **MCP Server** | 8001 | Strava API proxy with caching & rate limiting |

### MCP Server Endpoints (37 total)
The MCP server provides comprehensive Strava API coverage:

**Activities**: `/activities/recent`, `/activities/all`, `/activities/summary`, `/activities/search`, `/activities/{id}`, `/activities/{id}/map`, `/activities/{id}/streams`, `/activities/{id}/laps`, `/activities/{id}/comments`, `/activities/{id}/kudos`, `/activities/{id}/zones`

**Segments**: `/segments/{id}`, `/segments/{id}/efforts`, `/segments/{id}/leaderboard`, `/segments/{id}/streams`, `/segments/starred`, `/segment_efforts/{id}/streams`

**Routes**: `/routes`, `/routes/{id}`, `/routes/{id}/streams`, `/routes/{id}/export_gpx`, `/routes/{id}/export_tcx`

**Clubs**: `/clubs`, `/clubs/{id}`, `/clubs/{id}/activities`, `/clubs/{id}/members`, `/clubs/{id}/admins`

**Athlete**: `/athlete/stats`, `/athlete/zones`

**Gear**: `/gear/{id}`

**Write Operations**: `POST /activities`, `PUT /activities/{id}`, `PUT /athlete`, `PUT /segments/{id}/starred`

## 🚀 Recent Changes

### Jan 26, 2026 (Refactor Complete)
- **Agent Loop Architecture**: Transitioned backend to a true "Agentic" loop where the LLM can call tools iteratively to solve complex queries.
- **Sync & Comparison Tools**: Added `sync_activities` capability for on-demand data refresh and logic for multi-year comparisons.
- **Improved Prompt Engineering**: Taught the agent to use specific tools for "This month vs Last month" queries, matching the capability of code-execution agents.
- **API Quota Protection (CRITICAL)**:
   - **Incremental Sync**: Rewrote `sync_activities` to allow "Smart Sync". It now stops fetching pages as soon as it finds known activities, reducing a typical sync from 70+ calls (full history) to just 1 call (latest page).
   - **Extended Cache**: Increased Cache TTL from 1 hour to 24 hours to further minimize redundant fetching.
- **Superlative Query Fixes**: (Prior items...)
- **Superlative Query Fix**: Fixed deterministic handling of "longest", "fastest", "most recent" queries.
  - Implemented logic to prioritize 'distance' over 'moving_time' for 'longest' queries strings.
  - Ensures a single, top-ranked activity is returned for superlative queries.
- **Segment Display Refinement**:
  - improved markdown formatting for segment lists.
  - ensured segment links are only displayed when valid data exists.
  - Removed map visualizations from AI responses to prevent localhost/broken link issues.

### Jan 25, 2026
- **API Quota Optimization**: Disabled background hydration triggers; switched to on-demand enrichment.
- **Oldest-First Optimization**: Added intelligent chronological fetching for "first time" queries.
- **Feature Parity**: Added comprehensive endpoint coverage (Streams, Laps, Routes, etc.).
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved `NameError` in f-strings and frontend loading UI.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. Segment Search Requires Enriched Data
- **Issue**: Segment data is only available for activities that have been enriched
- **Current Solution**: Query by date first (e.g., "segments from my run yesterday"), which enriches the activity on-demand

### 2. Strava API Rate Limits
- **Limit**: 100 requests per 15 minutes, 1000 per day
- **Mitigation**: Rate limiter prevents exceeding limits; queries show remaining quota

### 3. Full-History Private Note Search
- **Issue**: Strava List API does not return `private_note` or `description` fields
- **Impact**: Cannot search all historical notes without fetching full details for every activity
- **Solution**: Search notes for specific date ranges or use on-demand enrichment

## 💡 How to Resume

1. **Start Services**: `./start_services.sh`
2. **Open App**: [https://activitycopilot.app](https://activitycopilot.app) or `http://localhost:5173`
3. **Check Status**: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/status`
4. **View Logs**: `tail -f backend_new.log mcp_new.log`

## 🎯 Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Per-User Rate Limiting**: Key rate limiter by athlete_id for true multi-tenancy
- [ ] **Scheduled Sync**: Optional overnight hydration for pre-cached data
- [ ] **Data Export**: Allow users to export enriched data as JSON/CSV
- [ ] **Saved Queries**: Save complex comparison queries as dashboard widgets
